Hello, welcome to the README for my submission for our Programming Project for COMP 3270.

Name: Luke Welton
Files Involved: main.cpp, algorithms.h, algorithms.cpp, phw_input.txt

There is also Algorithm Calculations.docx in this archive, which includes calculations for the complexity/speed of each algorithm,
as well as an analysis on these calculations vs actual measured data.
And of course, there is this file, the README.

I compiled this program on my local machine as well as the University's Tux Machine to ensure maximum accuracy.
On my machine, I used CLion, compiling/running in a WSL Environment running Ubuntu.
On the tux machine, I used G++ using the command "g++ -o proj main.cpp algorithms.h algorithms.cpp"

My results included in the graph in computation vs measurement analysis were from the Tux Machine,
as my computer's accuracy with measuring time was extremely low.
Unfortunately, to match my numbers, as well as compensate for the tux machine's seemingly low accuracy as well,
I had to write the code in a way that makes the runtime approximately 11 minutes.
I apologize to the grader!

I certify that I wrote the code I am submitting.
I did not copy whole or parts of it from another student of have another person write the code for me.
Any code I am reusing in my program is clearly marked as such with its source clearly identified in comments.
